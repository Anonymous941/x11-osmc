# x11-osmc
Installing X11, xTerm, Chromium and a virtual mouse and keyboard, controlled via the official OSMC-remote.

* Arrow-keys controlls the pointer.
* Play-key is Left-click.
* Stop-key is Right-click.
* Home-key toggles the on-screen keyboard.
* Info-key to exit right click menus without selcting

After user request I've added a autostarting script that ask if you wanna keep the virtual mouse enabled, clicking ok on the remote just keeps the settings, you need keyboard or a real mouse to disable the function. It will still be disabled next time you start, but you will be asked to re-enable it, defualt ok click on remote enables the virtual mouse again. (Alt+n on a keyboard or clicking on No button with a real mouse keeps it disabled)

Enjoy
